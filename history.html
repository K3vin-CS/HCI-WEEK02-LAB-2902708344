        <h2>Early Origins</h2>
        <p>Jakarta’s history traces back to the 4th century CE, when it was a bustling port known as Sunda Kelapa. This port was part of the Sunda Kingdom, a powerful maritime kingdom that thrived on trade with merchants from China, India, the Middle East, and other parts of Southeast Asia. Sunda Kelapa was especially known for exporting pepper and spices, which were in high demand in global markets.</p>
        <p>In the early 16th century, the arrival of Portuguese traders marked the beginning of European interest in the region. However, the local population, under the leadership of Fatahillah from the Demak Sultanate, defeated the Portuguese in 1527. The city was renamed **Jayakarta**, which means “victorious deed” or “complete victory” in Sanskrit.</p>

        <h2>Colonial Period: Batavia Under Dutch Rule</h2>
        <p>In 1619, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) seized control of Jayakarta after conflicts with the local rulers and renamed it **Batavia**. The city became the administrative and commercial hub of the Dutch East Indies. Batavia grew rapidly as a center for spice trade and colonial governance, attracting merchants and settlers from around the world.</p>
        <p>The city’s layout was modeled after Dutch cities, featuring canals, European-style buildings, and a grid-like street system. However, tropical diseases, poor sanitation, and social inequalities made Batavia one of the most challenging colonial capitals in the region. Over time, Batavia expanded beyond its walled city into surrounding areas, forming the foundation of modern-day Jakarta.</p>

        <h2>Japanese Occupation and the Road to Independence</h2>
        <p>During World War II, the Japanese occupied Batavia from 1942 to 1945, renaming it **Jakarta Tokubetsu Shi**. The occupation disrupted Dutch control and inspired Indonesian nationalist movements. After Japan’s surrender, Indonesian leaders **Soekarno** and **Mohammad Hatta** proclaimed independence on **August 17, 1945**.</p>
        <p>However, it was not until **December 27, 1949**, after years of diplomatic struggle and armed resistance, that the Dutch formally recognized Indonesia’s independence. Jakarta was then declared the official capital of the new Republic of Indonesia.</p>

        <h2>Jakarta in the Modern Era</h2>
        <p>Since independence, Jakarta has undergone massive transformations. It became the center of government, culture, and economic activity in Indonesia. The city saw rapid urbanization, with millions of people migrating from rural areas seeking opportunities. Despite facing challenges such as traffic congestion, flooding, and overpopulation, Jakarta continues to evolve as a major global metropolis.</p>
        <p>Today, Jakarta is not only the heart of Indonesia’s political and economic life but also a symbol of its rich and complex history — a city shaped by centuries of trade, colonialism, struggle, and resilience.</p>
