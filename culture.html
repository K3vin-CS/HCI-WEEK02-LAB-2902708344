        <h2>A Cultural Melting Pot</h2>
        <p>Jakarta’s culture is a vibrant blend of traditions, languages, cuisines, festivals, and beliefs. As the capital of Indonesia and the largest city in Southeast Asia, Jakarta attracts people from every province and ethnic group, resulting in a rich cultural landscape that continues to evolve.</p>
        <p>At the heart of Jakarta’s identity are the <strong>Betawi people</strong>, the city’s original inhabitants. Their culture is a fusion of Javanese, Sundanese, Chinese, Arabic, and European influences, reflecting centuries of interaction and trade. Today, Betawi traditions remain visible in daily life — from food and clothing to music, dance, and architecture.</p>

        <h2>Traditional Arts and Performances</h2>
        <p>Jakarta offers a wide range of traditional and contemporary performing arts. Betawi cultural performances such as <em>Lenong</em> (theatrical comedy), <em>Gambang Kromong</em> (music ensemble combining Chinese and Indonesian instruments), and <em>Topeng Betawi</em> (mask dance) are regularly performed during festivals and community events.</p>
        <p>In addition to Betawi arts, Jakarta also hosts performances from across Indonesia — including Balinese dance, Javanese gamelan, Papuan tribal dances, and Minangkabau martial arts displays — making the city a national stage for Indonesia’s cultural diversity.</p>

        <p>Food is another major part of Jakarta’s culture. The city’s culinary scene reflects the diversity of its population and history. Betawi cuisine blends influences from Malay, Chinese, Arabic, Dutch, and Indian cuisines, creating unique and flavorful dishes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kerak Telor</strong> – a spicy omelet made from sticky rice and duck eggs, often served at festivals.</li>
          <li><strong>Soto Betawi</strong> – a rich coconut-milk soup made with beef and spices.</li>

          <li><strong>Asinan Betawi</strong> – a tangy salad with pickled vegetables and peanut sauce.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Street food culture is also thriving in Jakarta. From night markets to roadside stalls, you can find everything from satay skewers and bakso meatballs to spicy nasi goreng and traditional sweets.</p>
